# Kaggle - What's Cooking
This repository holds my solution to the Kaggle [What's Cooking](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking) competition,
which I took part in for my CS4487 Machine Learning course project. The slides from my class presentation are included.

My best submission put me at the 32nd position on the public leaderboard (at the time of submission).
At the end of the competition, my final position is at 137 out of 1388 participants (top 10%).
